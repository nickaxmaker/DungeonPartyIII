# Dungeon Party III

## Introduction

This project was a learning tool and I followed a tutorial which can be found [here at RogueLikeTutorials](http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/1). Everything in here is re-typed by myself to make sure that I understood every line as it went into the project, but it's mostly the tutorial's work. Fantastic tutorial to go through if you're interested in more Python3 or learning how basic Roguelike elements work together or if you're interested in the library used, LibTCod, which is a popular open source roguelike library. 

## Learning Goals

I was attempting to learn the following things while working on this project. 

1. Higher level of familiarity with Python3.
2. Understanding the flow of an entire object-oriented project.
3. Understanding the elements that made up a roguelike game. 
4. Using an open-source library for the purpose of making project more efficient.

Of these goals, I would say that all of them were accomplished in this project. This was one of the first projects of any size that I had seen that used object-oriented programming, so it was nice to see how everything worked together. 

### Disclaimer

This project was forked from another account of mine, due to this being the final resting place of finished projects, whereas the other is a place where I generally put random unfinished ideas.
